# spotify-current-song
Gets the users current song and writes it to a file.

## TODO
- [ ] Consider if it's worth doing the below - It's just me that's using this at the moment
- [ ] Consider if it's worth removing the Spotify library - it's casuing the dist to be much larger than it needs to be.  Should be fairly simple, use snip as a guide
- [ ] Fix the login - it's asking you to authorize every time
- [ ] Figure out how to add an icon to the published exe
- [ ] Write a guide on how to use it and configure it.  It should work on linux
- [ ] Create a release on github and link to it
- [ ] Make sure i'm on this list: https://johnnycrazy.github.io/SpotifyAPI-NET/docs/next/showcase/
